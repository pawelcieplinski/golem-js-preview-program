### Feedback:
Please provide any feedback you have regarding each task step below:

#### Step 1: Create a script that will start HTTP server on port 3000

Well described step, so I had no problems with it.

#### Step 2: Create a `/tts` endpoint that accepts `q` query param with input text

Task step was very precise, I took me a while just because it was my first time with Node.js and Express.js. It was a bit challenging to provide downloading of generated file but not because of Golem, but because of Node.js and Express.js. I had to do some research to find out how to do it.

#### Step 3: Schedule task with received text to be converted on Golem Network

I decided to use code written in first task, so it saved me some time. For users that would have to perform this task from scratch, it could be hard to do it without sample code from first t2s task.

#### Step 4: Scale number of contracted providers as more requests are received

I am not 100% sure if I did it correctly, but it works well for multiple requests at the same time. Task executioner's `maxParallelTasks` option did its job allowing me to perform multiple tasks from Golem Network. If it wasn't case for the step and task itself then I would recommend to add some more information about scaling and how to do it.

## General feedback:
Is there anything else you'd like to share about your experience 
completing this task or using the Golem Network in general? 

I think that as a single task, it could be more difficult than challenging. This task works great as a next step to knowing Golem Network and its features. I think that it would be great to have some more tasks like this one, but with more complex features of Golem Network.
